# Calculus-Solver
## Plans
We just created some basic data types for Prof Joosten to give feedback on. By Friday, we will complete basic parsing. By the following Friday, we will have all the other methods done such that our project can perform basic calculus. By the last Friday of class, we will have implemented a special feature.

## Instructions
Our data structures, as well as example usages, can be found in src/DataStructures.hs.
