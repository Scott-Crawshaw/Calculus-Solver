# Calculus-Solver
## Completed
We have created appropriate data structures and have developed a parser that can parse even complex expressions into said data structures. The parser can work with binary operations such as +, -, *, ^, and /, as well as unary operations such as sin, cos, ln, -, and + (+ and - as prefixes).

## Need to Complete
Now that we have appropriate data structues and basic parsing, we just need to perfom that actual calculus. By Friday, we should have the calculus completed, and our program should be able to generate steps for the user to follow.

## Instructions
To test our parser, simply run 'stack install' and then run the generated executable. You will be prompted to enter an expression, and will recieve a printed version of the expression parsed into data types.
